## A blog and much, much more.

This is my personal website repository. I decided to make it open source because someone else might benefit from the work i have done over the years even though, at times, some functionality might not have the perfect implementation, so take it as it is if you want :)

Most features have an equivalent admin space where things can be configured.

## What does it do?

- A blog infrastructure
  - Support for multi users (though admin is not there)
  - Tagged posts
  - Post creation with preview, title suggestions, and a poster image per post (using LiveUploads)
- Dynamic pages
  - Similar to blog posts, except with no tags (useful for semi-static information)


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
